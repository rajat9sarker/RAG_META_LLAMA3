It is recommended for the short-term treatment of mild to moderate \\npain such as headache, toothache, muscle and joint pain and menstrual pain.  \\nIt also relieves fever associated with common colds and flu. \\n \\nYou must talk to a doctor if you do not feel better or if you feel worse after 3 days of fever and 5 days \\nof pain or if other symptoms appear.  \\n \\nParacetamol is indicated in adults and adolescents aged 12 or older. \\n \\n2.

Higher doses than \\nrecommended will not lead to better pain relief, instead it increases the risk of very severe liver damage. \\nThe symptoms of liver damage usually appear after a few days. It is therefore important that you \\ncontact a doctor immediately if you have taken too high a dose, even if you are feeling fine. \\n \\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Paracetamol.  \\n- if you have kidney problems   \\n- if you have liver problems   '),\n",

You should use the lowest possible dose that \\nreduces your pain and/or your fever and use it for the shortest time possible.

As \\nParacetamol can in rare cases lead to a deteriorated immune system due to a lack of white blood cells, \\ninfections can become serious. For this reason, it is also important that you inform health care personnel \\nabout your medication \\n \\nStevens-Johnson syndrome / TEN/AGEP \\nStop taking Paracetamol and immediately contact a doctor or go to the emergency department if you \\nexperience the following symptoms: Extremely intense and serious skin reactions, such as Stevens-\\nJohnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) \\nhave been reported during use of Paracetamol. \\nThe adverse reaction of the skin may appear as rashes with or without blisters. Skin irritation, sores or \\nswelling in the mouth, throat, eyes, nose and around the genitals (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) and fever \\nand flulike symptoms may occur. The skin rashes may develop into serious widespread skin damage \\n(peeling of the epidermis and superficial mucous membranes) with life-threatening consequences. \\nIf symptoms of AGEP appear, it usually occurs in conjunction with the start of treatment. \\n \\nAngioedema \\nStop using Paracetamol and immediately contact a doctor if you experience any of the following \\nsymptoms (angioedema): swelling of the face, tongue or throat; difficulty swallowing; hives and \\nbreathing difficulties. \\n \\nIn rare cases allergic reactions are observed – itching, rash, very rarely – changes in the blood count, \\ne.g. thrombocytopenia (decrease of the number of blood plates). \\n \\nRare (may affect up to 1 in 1000 users): \\n \\n- Angioedema, very severe allergic reaction (swelling of the face, tongue or throat, difficulty \\nswallowing, hives and difficulty breathing) '),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'paracetamol.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content=' 5\\n- Allergic reactions such as skin rashes and hives. Even less severe forms of skin reactions, rashes \\nand itching may occur. \\n- Liver impact. This can be very serious and can produce symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, \\nvomiting, stomach upset and loss of appetite. \\n \\nVery rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 users): \\n \\n- Bleeding from the skin and mucous membranes and bruises, general lethargy, tendency to \\ninflammation (infections) especially sore throat and fever due to changes in the blood (decreased \\nnumber of white blood cells and platelets).  \\n- Severe breathing difficulties with panting breathing.  \\n- Kidney side effects.  \\n- Paleness, fatigue and jaundice due to severe anaemia.  \\n- Very rare cases of severe skin reactions have been reported.  \\n- Anaphylaxis: hypersensitivity reaction with fever, skin rash, swelling, and sometimes a drop in \\nblood pressure. \\n \\nIn case of long-term use of high doses of Paracetamol, the functions of the liver may be impaired (the \\nskin and the eyes become yellow, nausea, stomach pain or discomfort, easily getting tired).  \\n \\nIf any of the side effects becomes serious or if you notice other side effects, which are not listed in this \\nleaflet, please, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. \\n \\nReporting of side effects \\nIf you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in \\nthis leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via HPRA Pharmacovigilance, Website: \\nwww.hpra.ie. \\n \\nBy reporting side effects, you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine. \\n \\n \\n5. How to store Paracetamol \\n \\nKeep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. \\n \\nStore below 25°С.  \\n \\nDo not use this drug after the expiry date which is stated on the cardboard package. The expiry date \\nrefers to the last day of the month. \\n \\nDo not use this drug if you notice a breach of the integrity of the blister or a change in the colour of the \\ntablets. \\n \\nDo not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to \\nthrow away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment. \\n \\n \\n6.

Note that this answer choice only includes individuals who are 12 or older, which matches the indication for paracetamol in the text. The other options do not match the indication for paracetamol in the text. Option A) Children under 12 is incorrect because paracetamol is not recommended for children under 12 years of age. Option C) Frail, immobile elderly is also incorrect because the text does not specify any particular age range for frail, immobile elderly individuals. Finally, option D) All of the above is incorrect because it includes all three incorrect options. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Adults and adolescents over 12. ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]> <![]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]>]]> <![ <![ &#'"
